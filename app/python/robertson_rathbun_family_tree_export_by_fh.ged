2 CONT Memories of Orren R Robertson by his son, Donald R Robertson
2 CONT 
2 CONT MARCH 23, 2009
2 CONT 
2 CONT Orren R Robertson was born on a farm near Hastings, Nebraska in September 1891.  He was the oldest of three sisters and two brothers.  The sisters were named Lulu Norton, Alta Ficken, and Gertrude ( I can't remember her married name.)  All wer
2 CONC e living in Ft. Morgan when they died except maybe Gertrude (Gertie).  Her brothers were Vern (He and his wife and son left Colorado in the Depression and moved to Foster, Oregon, near Sweet Home.) and Proe (He and his family left Colorado in th
2 CONC e Depression-about 1937-and moved to Arlington, Washington.  Both made a living on small farms milking cows, raising berrries, etc.  My Dad moved with his parents and siblings to New Raymer, Colorado (30 miles north of Ft. Morgan) by train (live
2 CONC stock, furniture, machinery, etc.) in 1910.  My grandfather, Granville Sylvester Robertson, and my Dad each took out homesteads. The land was federal land that was given to those people who would "prove up" on it (meaning plow and farm and buil
2 CONC d a home)within five years.  It was dry country and they could homestead only 160 or 320 acres, I can't remember which.  That seems like a lot of land, but it wouldn't support a family.  So the alternative was to be able to buy more acreage or m
2 CONC ove on.  My Dad and family had to move on. He and my mother had met at a dance somewhere between the valley and New Raymer.  My Dad courted my Mom by traveling from his farm down to the valley by horse and wagon in the summer and horse and sleig
2 CONC h in the winter.  They attended dances and my Dad played with his Dad on the violin and Vern's wife played the piano.  (When my Dad and Mom married they farmed at New Raymer a few years, before moving to Denver to farm, actually.)
2 CONT  
2 CONT My Dad was a gentle man about 5' 7" tall, very handsome, had a good sense of humor, never was angry that I remember.  He worked very hard, but with a sixth grade education the job field was limited.  His first love was farming and he tried it fo
2 CONC r years.  Before I was born he and my mom and his Dad all moved to the Denver area and grew vegetables on what were called truck farms.  They picked the vegetables and early each morning drove to downtown Denver and sold their produce to the bro
2 CONC kers who in turn sold to the groceries.  His father, your great grandfather, became blind due to diabetes.  They all gave up the truck farming and moved to dry land farms near Hugo, Colorado.  That's where I was born, on the farm.  My brother, O
2 CONC rval, was 10 and sister, Eleanor, was 8.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Just after I was born my Dad and Mom and family moved back to the valley near Ft. Morgan (about 100 miles north).  Even though the land near Hugo was a good deal better than that near New Raymer, the crops and prices were too low to sustain a fa
2 CONC mily there.  They moved to an irrigated farm  west of Ft Morgan owned by my Mom's grandmother and raised sugar beets and had some livestock.  We still lived there when I started first grade, but my Dad had lost two years of sugar beet crops du
2 CONC e to freezing.  So we moved to Ft. Morgan at Christmas time and I finished first grade through high school there.  My Dad still wanted to work in farming, so we moved from farms where he worked as a hired hand and back and forth to town as the j
2 CONC obs petered out.  By the 1930's the Depression had hit and there were no jobs in town.  My Dad walked the streets days at a time looking for work and the chance to buy some food for a few coins.
2 CONT 
2 CONT I don't remember him as particularly sad or morose even then.  He was just "steady".  We never had a real close relationship and I can't explain why other than he was wearing himself out either looking for work or doing hard labor jobs.
2 CONT 
2 CONT About the time World War II got into full swing the jobs starting picking up and he had steady work.  By this time I was in high school and dealing with my own self concerns and obsessions, so our relationships didn't get much closer.
2 CONT 
2 CONT I seemed to have the attitude that I was getting too sophisticated for my parents
2 CONT by then.  I guess the feeling was that they weren't hep as I saw it to the modern world.
2 CONT 
2 CONT MAY 11, 2009
2 CONT 
2 CONT In Fort Morgan in my growing up days most people had an ashpit in their back yards.  It was a rather large concrete structrure sort of shaped like a bell.  In those days most trash and garbage was burned in the ashpit, so it was an often used st
2 CONC ructure.  
2 CONT 
2 CONT One day when I was nearing, or had reached 16, my dad took me out for a driving lesson.  Our car was a 1937 Willys.  (In those days there were Willys passenger cars.  During the war Willys was producing jeeps.) 
2 CONT 
2 CONT We drove around the town (the streets in Fort Morgan are nice and wide and at that time were either paved or gravelled) without incident.  Then we drove into the alley behind our house and, guess what, I drove right into the ashpit and broke i
2 CONC t into several big and small pieces.  I expected the worst from my Dad, but true to his nature he just chuckled.  Later he went out and put it back together.  He fastened it together with wire and as far as I can remember it continued to get use
2 CONC d as our ashpit as long as we lived there.  Your Grandfather Robertson was a kind, even-tempered man.  For my benefit he should probably have had me do the repairs.  But he did the repairs himself.  Regardless it was an event I will always remem
2 CONC ber, so maybe there was a lesson somewhere for me there.
2 CONT 
2 CONT JULY 30, 2009
2 CONT 
2 CONT The Depression hit in 1929.  My Dad was farming on my Mother's paternal Grandmother's (Grandma Saunier) irrigated farm near Weldona, CO (a few miles west of Fort Morgan, CO in the South Platte River Valley).  He was raising primarily sugar beets
2 CONC , but I remember we had a potato cellar so that may have been old and abandoned, or used to store the family's needs or to store potatoes for the market.  Anyway we were frozen out of the sugar beets at least two years in a row.  So it called fo
2 CONC r a move to town, meaning Fort Morgan.  We actually moved at Christmas time of my first grade.
2 CONT  
2 CONT As I have said before my Dad was a very hard worker.   He was always in bed befpre 10:00 pm and up by 6:00 am.  He had a couple of physical problems, but none kept him from work.  He had a bad hernia and to his death wore a leather support rathe
2 CONC r than having surgery (if it was even common then).  He never saw a dentist except to have a tooth pulled.  There wasn't money to afford dental work.  Consequently at his death many of his teeth were missing. He had cataracts on his eyes advance
2 CONC d enough that he could hardly see even with very strong glasses.  Despite these he was still gentle and kind and unassuming.
2 CONT   
2 CONT His job, or lack thereof, carried us from many homes on farms and in Fort Morgan (my Mom and I figured about 15 before I graduated from high school and left home for good).  I can no longer remember the order of where he worked and where we live
2 CONC d.  I think we ended up on what was called the Bird Farm toward the beginning.  It was owned by a lady we all called, Ol' Lady Bird.  She had a hired man working for  her named Bert Ross.  We moved to the farm and lived in the helper's house.
2 CONT 
2 CONT One of Bert Ross' daughters was named Roberta and was in my class in school.  In that school district school buses brought every kid from ten miles or so around to school in Ft. Morgan.  I remember Ol' Lady Bird came to our house to talk to my p
2 CONC arents once or twice.  She was always nattily dressed in a big hat and fancy clothes.  Out of her purse she would pull a rather long tube with a cornet horn shape on one end.  She would put the other end of the tube in her ear and point the corn
2 CONC et end toward whoever was speaking.  That was her hearing aid of the day. She was a rather scary lady to me at best. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT My brother, Orval, and I shared a bed in the basement.  Sometimes we Indian wrestled, with him winning of course.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Every night the coyotes howled seemingly from all directions.  I always liked it on a farm and this was no exception except it wasn't a very pleasant job situation for my Dad.  We soon left, or he was fired, and moved to a small acreage just wes
2 CONC t of Ft. Morgan.  My Dad got hold of a tractor and some farm equipment and a tent, pans, bed, etc.and he and Orval did contract farming the Spring of 1935 on Kiowa Creek about 20 miles southwest of Ft. Morgan.  One morning in May they heard a bi
2 CONC g roar at about 5:00 a.m.   It was a flood on Kiowa Creek that had occurred following a big rain during the night.  They just managed to jump on the tractor and get to higher ground before the water hit their camp.  Everything was washed away
2 CONC .  We didn't know what had happened to them for a couple of days.  They couldn't get to Ft. Morgan from where they were, for a while, but they managed somehow to get across the South Platte River somewhere up river.  Then they came in from the N
2 CONC orth side of the river across the bridge still standing north of Ft. Morgan and finally got home.  Several days later I went with them up the river to look for their tent, etc.  I was surprised when they found the tent and a chair and some othe
2 CONC r things caught up in a tree.
2 CONT  
2 CONT Well that was essentially the end of his farming career, but he always talked about how he knew he could make a living farming.  We moved into Ft. Morgan, the folks rented a two story house with space for a big garden and chickens.  There was ro
2 CONC om for a couple of rooms upstairs to be rented out to a couple named Crumley.  This was a nice deal for me because we backed up onto the school grounds where I was now about a third grader.  Orval found a job delivering bread to stores in town
2 CONC s up the river from Ft. Morgan.  My sister, Eleanor or Sis (8 yrs older than me) worked as a maid for a well-to-do family a few blocks away.  Unfortunately my Dad was not so fortunate.  He applied for a job with the WPA (Works Progress Administr
2 CONC ation) which hired men when space was available on public construction jobs at $40 per month.  He finally got on to the WPA as a laborer.  It seems those jobs had term limits because he was often without work even then.  Some time later he go
2 CONC t a job on the County at $60 per month.  This too didn't always last and he often seemed to feel he was being cheated by someone who had more pull.  There was unquestionably a lot of chicanery of a political or "brown-nosing" nature that made i
2 CONC t possible for some men to keep the plum jobs and not get laid off.  Along with the WPA we were also on "welfare"  meaning that the family could get clothes, beans, flour, etc. courtesy of the US Government.  In those days, unlike it seems today
2 CONC , the clothes you wore identified the social status of the person and I had to wear overalls with a very square cut totally unlike store bought clothes.
2 CONT 
2 CONT My Dad did work at a big cattle feed lot for a while but got laid off from that.  The owner was a Jewish man and my Dad decided he didn't like Jews.  Italian people were called "Wops" in those days, and he didn't  feel good about them, but I don
2 CONC 't know why unless it was because of some of the Italian farmers who survived the bad times and were our neighbors from back in the older days on "Grandma Saunier's" farm. 
2 CONT  
2 CONT Well for years in town work was what could be picked up here and there.  He walked the streets many days looking for work.  With the Depression what it was and with only a sixth grade education jobs were extremely rare for him at best.  I rememb
2 CONC er when we lived in an apartment across the railroad tracks south of town, my Dad came home with a big bunch of very ripe bananas, something very rare for us, that a grocery owner had given him.  We were thrilled, but somewhat taken aback whe
2 CONC n a big black tarantula crawled out of the banana bunch.  We still enjoyed the special treat.
2 CONT  
2 CONT Along in the late 30's he got a job with Jack's Bean Company that turned out to be about the first "permanent" job he had had.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Jack's Bean Co. bought pinto beans from farmers, cleaned them up, and marketed them to grocers.  My Dad worked in the elevator as it's called for a couple of years.  Then he got a job with Rodney Elevator Company, which bought and marketed all k
2 CONC inds of grains like corn, wheat, barley, oats, pinto beans, etc.  By then threats of war in Europe was starting to boost the economy a bit and he was able to hold onto that job for several years.  His age was beginning to catch up with him and h
2 CONC e eventually lost that job --- because he was more accident prone.  He got a job with a lumber company, helping to deliver and unload lumber.  However he fell off the truck one day and broke or very badly bruised his tail bone.  I don't recall h
2 CONC is returning to commercial work after that.  
2 CONT  
2 CONT We attended the Presbyterian Church at that time and he did get a job there as the custodian and groundskeeper.  He held that for several years.  In fact when he died at home at about 8:00 am in the morning in September 1967 he had already pu
2 CONC t  in an hour or so at the church raking leaves.  He had come home for breakfast before going back to the church just a few blocks away.  He died at the breakfast table of what was called a "massive heart attack".  He had just passed his 77th bi
2 CONC rthday.
2 CONT  
2 CONT My Dad was a wonderful person who had a rather discouraging life in that he so wanted to be a farmer.  He was committed to one thing and that was doing what ever had to be done to support his family of six.  I don't remember his having much tim
2 CONC e or the where-with-all for vacations or for such mundane things sometimes as an old car to drive to work  But I do remember his twinkle in his eye, his teasing my mother, and his usually unspoken yet obviously caring presence.  Unfortunatel
2 CONC y I was growing up, wanted out of the shy, angry way I felt, and found it hard to keep from blaming my parents for my situation.  So we never developed a real happy relationship, my Dad and I, and that is a nagging regret.  Still I know he was a
2 CONC lways there for me in his own way.

1 NOTE 
2 CONT 
2 CONT There is a source (based on cemetery records re: Keller Cemetery, Clinton Co, MO) that has the death date of Lewis G Sherman as sometime in 1856.  Then his wife apparently died less than a year later.  This would explain why the five children ar
2 CONC e living with different families in 1860.  (Lucinda hasn't been found.)
2 CONT 
2 CONT However, there is a different story.  I had no clue but online I found a Lewis G Sherman had died at the Battle of Wilson Creek, MO in 1861.  My dad had never been able to find his civil war records; our family tradition has him dying in the civ
2 CONC il war.  It turns out he had enlisted in Leavenworth, Kansas in May 1861, according to the records for the Lewis G Sherman I found online.  Leavenworth is right on the border of Kansas and Missouri and there is still a big military base there ac
2 CONC cording to the map.  Also, it is no more than 30 miles from the various homes listed for his four sons on the 1860 census.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Then when my dad typed up what is in his family bible and sent it to me, there was the same information and more.  The date and place of the mortal wounding is the same, Wilson is spelled "Willson" and the name of the commanding General is added
2 CONC .  The exact transcription is this: "Lewis G. Sherman was killed at the Battle of Willson Creek under command of Gen. Nathaniel Lyons 10th (?) of August 1861."
2 CONT 
2 CONT 
2 CONT For now I have to conclude that the cemetery records are in error.
2 CONT 
2 CONT However, that doesn't explain why Lewis can't be found in 1860.  A guess is that the family lost the farm before 1860.  If Sarah was in poor health they might have gone somewhere for help, or she and the daughter might have gone somewhere by the
2 CONC mselves, the boys were farmed out, and Lewis wandered toward Leavenworth where he eventually enlisted in May 1861.
2 CONT 
2 CONT However, the source that gives Lewis' death as 1856 says also that his wife died less than a year later.  Here is my tentative interpretation: Sarah, not Lewis, died in 1856, maybe in childbirth since Jesse died "as an infant or child".  Lewis f
2 CONC armed out the children and in 1861 joined the war.  When his body was brought home, he was buried next to his wife but the death date was not available so the wife's information was copied, making it appear that they both died in 1856.  That i
2 CONC s highly speculative.

1 NOTE 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Many thanks to my source (Richner-Sherman tree by Sue Richner), who states:
2 CONT "Rollan (Rolland) Sherman's mother was Sarah Ann Crank born 11/10/1827 in Ohio, died 11/16/1857 in Missouri, less than a year after her husband died, they are both buried in Keller Cemetery in Clinton County, Missouri, along with their younges
2 CONC t son Jessey Sherman, she was the daughter of Sylvester and Mary Polly (Sherman) Crank."
2 CONT 
2 CONT The 1850 census, if it's correct, suggests the 1827 birthdate is correct.  But census records are often inaccurate in this respect.  Our family bible gives her b.d. as 10 Nov 1823.  I believe this is a misreading of 1828; that would mean the cen
2 CONC sus age was off by less than 2 months.  I will use 1827 for now.
2 CONT 
2 CONT More from Sue Richner:
2 CONT "...have found a lot of information on Sarah Ann Crank their mother and her ancestors. Very interesting information, goes back to the 1500's in England, names were Mallory. Captain Roger Mallory, came to the US and settled in Virginia from Engla
2 CONC nd. His Grandfather Rev. Thomas Mallory was the Dean of Chester, in England."
1 NOTE 
2 CONT 
2 CONT from Sue Richner:
2 CONT May be a possibility that Captain Roger Mallory ties the Sherman family to the Actress Sissy Spacek. Still checking that out.
2 CONT 
2 CONT I read recently where it is believed that Lewis Gordon Sherman and Sarah Ann Crank were not only Husband and Wife but cousins as well. This is not proven as yet, but could be possible as Sarah's mother maiden name was also Sherman.

2 CONT 1850: She appears to be gone already with a 2 yr old (twin) daughter Matilda.  Looking over to the right we see she is clearly marked "over 20 cannot read or write".  Therefore it is apparent that her age written "2" had a final digit left off
2 CONC .  
2 CONT 
2 CONT 1860: She is definitely gone by now and James Sherman's next wife is living next door, Elizabeth B Payton.  The five children he has are probably Matilda's.

1 NOTE 
2 CONT 
2 CONT From the Annals of Wyoming it is learned that Sylvester, too young to be on the 1850 census, is brother of Rollan ("Rolon") Sherman, who got him one of his first jobs as a bullwhacker west of Denver.
2 CONT 
2 CONT From the census you can guess that he's a brother of Rollan since he follows the same pattern of the three known brothers, living with an apparently unrelated farm family in the area around St Joseph.  He's also the right age to have missed bein
2 CONC g on the 1850 census.  Also Rollan named one of his sons Sylvester.  Also he went from the same region of Missouri to the same region of Colorado around the same time.  Confirmed by another tree.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Age per 1850 census: 9.
2 CONT Age per 1860 census: 17
2 CONT 
2 CONT From the account written by his granddaughters, details of residence not entered in the database: 
2 CONT "The family spent two years in Harrison so the children could go to school.  In the early 1900's, Ves bought a hotel and bar in Guernsey.  Lulah finished the 8th grade there so she could teach school.  Her first school was the Meloy school.  (Th
2 CONC e little house still stands south of the two-story house 1 mile west of Lingle, south of the railroad tracks).  In the middle 1900's, Ves bought a grocery store and pool hall in Wyncote.  It burned down in 1907.  The Shermans continued to live i
2 CONC n Wyncote each school year until all of the children were out of school."

1 NOTE From death records of her children it is known her name is Mary Wilborn/Welborn.  I assume she's the sister of Simeon's wife Anna Welbourne.  Those children are Mary Parks, Simeon T, and Elizabeth Cool.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Living with son Zachariah 1880.  Her parents are both from North Carolina.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Apparently SimTim's wife doesn't know where her mo-in-law was born; her report to the census taker:
2 CONT 1880: Tennessee
2 CONT 1900: Tennessee
2 CONT 1920: US
2 CONT 
2 CONT But Mary is alive in 1880 and living w/ son Zach who knows she's b NC as are her parents.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Also, NC is given as her place of birth in these censuses:
2 CONT 1850 age 52
2 CONT 1856 age 57
2 CONT 1860 age 61
2 CONT 1870 age 71
2 CONT So I conclude that there is only one Mary; SimTim and Zach have the same mother and she's from NC.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Reputed names for this person (no documentation; from trees):
2 CONT Mary Elizabeth White or Betty Lou White, b 11 Apr 1799

2 CONT Rev. Jesse Wells Robinson - born: October 30, 1803 Kentucky - son of Nathan and Anne Leach Robertson. About 1815-1818, Nathan moved his family from Kentucky to the western portion of Jennings County, Indiana, moved to Jefferson County, Indiana f
2 CONC or one year and then purchased land from the government and settled near Paris Crossing in Jennings County. The Robertson family united with the Graham Fork Church in 1822 and then along with other members from Graham Fork Church, convened at th
2 CONC e house of Thomas Hill, Jr. and organized a church known as the Coffee Creek Baptist Church. 
2 CONT Jesse Wells married July 24, 1823 Jennings County to Nancy Scott - born: May 28, 1801 Kentucky - daughter of Thomas and Sarah Scott who both are buried in the pioneer section of Coffee Creek Baptist Church Cemetery. 
2 CONT Jesse Wells Robinson was licensed to preach at Coffee Creek Baptist Church and ordained there in 1837 along with John Hill. He remained in the Coffee Creek Baptist Association but a few years. However, on several occasions delivered the introduc
2 CONC tory sermon at association meetings. 
2 CONT He moved to Scott County, Indiana for a short spell and then settled in Jackson County, Indiana, where he carried on an active ministry. It was largely through his efforts that Liberty Association was organized in 1847. He was pastor of severa
2 CONC l churches in the Dudleytown and Seymour area 
2 CONT Jesse Wells Robinson died October 22, 1855 and was buried in the Old Douglas School House Cemetery in Jackson County. Jesse's wife, Nancy, returned to Jennings County and rejoined the Coffee Creek Baptist Church. She died May 12, 1872 and becaus
2 CONC e her death is listed in the church records, it is assumed she is buried in the pioneer section of the church cemetery. No tombstone was found for her.
2 CONT For some reason Jesse's decendants chose the spelling of Robinson over the spelling of Robertson. Most decendants uses the Robertson spelling.

1 NOTE Acc to one tree there are two Elizabeth, an Eliz M and an Eliz Emeline.  Not likely to be two different people.  There is only one on the 1850 census, age 12.
2 CONT Elizabeth Emeline acc to other trees.  I think Emeline is wife of Samuel, Elizabeth's brother.  They are listed together at the bottom of the family 1860.  PROOF: If you look at the whole row, they are BOTH marked "married within the year" but N
2 CONC EITHER has a spouse listed.  So they have to be married to each other.

1 NOTE 
2 CONT 
2 CONT 1885 Guthrie Co IA:  Lives with Simeon P Robertson & family and his brother Granville Sylvester Robertson.  Simeon Robertson and Sylvester Kiff are from New York.
2 CONT 
2 CONT 1860 Hudson, Walworth Co, WI:  There is a Henry Dayton b: 1833 living next to Stephen S Kiff; both are from New York.  In 1850 Hudson this Henry (age 17) is living with his family who are all from New York.  His father's name is Ebenezer.
2 CONT 
2 CONT 1855 Walworth Twp, Walworth Co, WI: There is a David R Sergeant according to the state census index.
2 CONT 
2 CONT The above coincidences were all discovered in the course of trying to find the family or origin for Mary Jane Sergeant, wife of Henry Dayton b: 1835.  There is a Jane b: 1836 married to Henry b: 1833 (1860 Hudson).  Their two small children coul
2 CONC d be older siblings of the Henry and Mary Jane Dayton family I have in 1870.
2 CONT 
2 CONT But I already had found a Henry Dayton b: 1835 living in 1850 Hadley, Saratoga, NY, with Lucinda named-afters in the family and a mother from New Hampshire; which sounds like the right person.  So the two Henry's aren't the same person but migh
2 CONC t be cousins; I will trace both families to try and select the right g-g-grandfather for myself.

2 CONT Notes from DRR:
2 CONT "Joseph Louis Saunier was born September 10, 1871 in Kansas. My mother had written in the family bible that the place was "New Chattell", KS. Later I figured out that New Chattell was really the French name Neuchatel. The area just to the east o
2 CONC f where his father, Constantine Saunier was born in France was also called Neuchatel. That area is in Switzerland and there is a fairly large city called , Neuchatel, there. I have other records that show that he [JOSEPH LOUIS] was born at Olsbu
2 CONC rg, KS in Pottawatomie County. He was the third of ten children born between 1869 and 1895. One sister died at about one year of age. All the others lived into adulthood. I have a note that says the family came to Colorado by covered wagon pulle
2 CONC d by oxen but I don't have the date. They settled in the "Weldon Valley" which is a broad valley of the South Platte River about ten miles upriver from Fort Morgan, Colorado where I grew up."
2 CONT 
2 CONT Notes from DRR:
2 CONT "Joseph L. Saunier worked as a cowboy, sheepherder, and farmer all his life. He also operated a livery stable in the little town of Weldona, CO. He kept horses, rented buggies, sold hay, harnesses and saddles, etc.
2 CONT 
2 CONT "He married Daisy Belle Sherman. She was born in Denver, but her family had a sheep ranch near Byers, CO.

2 CONT 1910: This is additional evidence that Stephen and Constantine Saunier are brothers.  Louis is living with a family next to Charles U Saunier in the same neighborhood where Constantine had owned a farm in 1900 with Louis J Saunier (Constantine'
2 CONC s son) living next door.  All the neighbors are the same so it appears Charles has taken over the farm.  The census doesn't say whether Charles is renting or not, but he is working for wages as Superintendent of Highways, rather than farming o

2 CONC 0 or 1821.
2 CONT 
2 CONT I am accepting Isaac and Jacob Dayton as his brothers based on other trees and the fact that they lived so close to each other for so long.  In 1850 he was recently dead but his four younger children live with Martin West AND Solomon M Crary.  S
2 CONC olomon was an early pioneer and a true pillar of the community.  Isaac P Bristol was also in the house and maybe head of house (owner?).  Next door was Isaac Sackett, who lived next to Isaac Dayton for a long time.  He was possibly descended fro
2 CONC m Augustus Sackett, founder of Sackett Harbor a few miles away.
2 CONT 
2 CONT There are Bristols and Sacketts in Panton, Addison Co, VT where the Daytons are supposed to be from, but I can't find the Daytons there.  Families named West are in New Haven, VT a few miles from Panton.

2 CONT 1880: His father is supposedly from New York and his mother from ?New Jersey.
2 CONT 
2 CONT 1870: He lives next door to the patriarch of the neighborhood, M H West, who has been in Potsdam since before the dawn of time and lived maybe in the same place all or most of that time, while the Daytons (and in 1840 the Sargents) lived next t
2 CONC o him or even with him.  Who he is I don't know but maybe his wife Anna is the sister of a Dayton.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Here is a hypothetical family.  Based on other trees let's say Thomas Dayton is the father of Henry Dayton Sr b: 1799, who is supposedly the father of my known ancestor Henry Dayton b: 1835 who m: Mary Jane Sargent.  I believe that this Jacob Da
2 CONC yton b: 1793 is the brother of Henry Dayton b: ~1799.  Also I believe that the wife of Martin H West b: 1797 is Anna Dayton b: 1793, another child of Thomas.
2 CONT 
2 CONT According to the source tree which is undocumented, I might be right about Jacob since there is a Jacob b: 1793 on the list.  However, the list of Dayton siblings doesn't contain an Anna as such.  But it does have Susan, Polly, Deborah, Betsy, a
2 CONC nd Louisa Dayton, all without birth dates or spouses.  They are maybe from a will or something.  "Polly" and "Betsy" are usually nicknames.  "Anna" is often a title-like first name for someone who goes by a middle name, especially in German fami
2 CONC lies who might name several daughters Anna, with unique middle names.  So Deborah, Louisa, and especially Susan (?Susanna) are also candidates for "Anna West".  It remains to be tested out.  Since Martin and Anna West were married before 1850, t
2 CONC he census won't do it.

2 CONT from Mary McClelland:
2 CONT Mary and Samuel.  I found their marriage date when I was searching on familysearch.org.  I was looking for info on the Bair family in Crawford county, KS, when I came across the date.  I'm just getting started on the Winger/Bair family tree, s
2 CONC o I really don't have much yet.  Ephraim Winger/Wingert was married to Anne M. Bair, who was related to your great grandmother.  I only have the date that her father, Isaac, died, but don't know anything about her mother.  Other Bair researcher
2 CONC s believe that John Bair and Elizabeth Shoemaker were her parents.  I believe her parents were Isaac and Anne E. Bair, they have two children in 1850 named Anne M. and Zachariah T.  These children were born about the same time as the Anne and Ta
2 CONC ylor that are living with John and Elizabeth in 1860.  John was living with his father, Christian in 1850 and there are no children that young in the household.
2 CONT I think your grgr grandfather Benjamin Bair may have been married three times, or Sophia was also called Anna.  I found him in the 1875 census for Elk county, KS with wife Anna and on the 1880 census it says he was widowed. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT I will let you know if I find anything that may be helpful.  I live in Crawford county, KS, so I can also check local records that are not online.

2 CONT 
2 CONT note: the Jacob, Isaac, and Henry Dayton below are brothers acc. to an online tree.  Isaac Sackett is probably related to the founder of the nearby town Sacketts Harbor (Augustus Sackett.)
2 CONT 
2 CONT 1820: Lives with his wife and a male who is his age--I believe this could be HENRY DAYTON.  Isaac Dayton and Isaac Sackett are next door neighbors to each other and don't live far away.
2 CONT 
2 CONT 1830: Lives next to Henry Dayton.  Jacob Dayton lives nearby.  Isaac Dayton and Isaac Sackett are next door neighbors to each other and don't live far away.  Has a daughter b: 1815-20.
2 CONT 
2 CONT 1840: Lives next to Amos Sargent, future father-in-law of Henry Dayton, who is 5 years old and lives not far away.  Lives next to Truman Sargent b: 1770s.  Lives next door to Isaac P Bristol.  Has a daughter b: 1815-1820. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT 1850: Lives with four of Henry A Dayton's younger children; Henry has recently died.  Lives next door to Isaac Sackett and his son Benjamin.  (See Isaac Dayton)  Lives with Isaac P Bristol b: 1818.  
2 CONT 
2 CONT 1860: Lives next door to the house where Henry E Dayton is a boarder and/or employee.  Lives with J C Bristol b: 1816.
2 CONT 
2 CONT 1870: Lives next door to Jacob Dayton b: 1797.  Lives with Charles M Dunbar and wife Orpha who is probably Martin West's daughter and probably his only child.
2 CONT 
2 CONT 1880: Lives with Charles and Orpha Dunbar.  First census where he isn't living with or next to Daytons.  (?except 1820 but see above)
2 CONT 
2 CONT CONCLUSION: It's obvious that MH West and Henry Dayton Sr. were closely tied in some way.  I believe that a search of Potsdam deeds will show that they were land partners in 1820.  Later Dayton got a different piece of property and rented his pr
2 CONC operty to the Sargents who then were living next to West in 1840.  After Henry Sr's death in 1849, his children moved in with West.  Later Henry's brother Jacob lived on the same property next to West.

2 CONT There is a bio on Isaac and his son Lyman in a history book available at ancestry.com: "History of St Lawrence County, New York."
2 CONT 
2 CONT 1850: Living with his son & family and his wife & daughter.  Next to a house (head : Isaac P Bristol) where his nieces and nephews live, shortly after the death of his brother Henry A Dayton.  In that house is also Martin H West, a close associa
2 CONC te of the Daytons, and Solomon M Crary, one of the early pioneers of Potsdam.  Also living next to Isaac Sackett.
2 CONT 
2 CONT COPIED FROM ROOTSWEB.COM TREE "Descendants of Joseph Sackett":
2 CONT 26 Jan 1824, Deed book 8, page 43, Isaac Sackett of Potsdam Sarah his 
2 CONT wife of 1 st part, and Isaac Dayton of Potsdam as 2nd part for $311.40 in 
2 CONT Town of Potsdam. 
2 CONT END OF QUOTE
2 CONT 
2 CONT The apparent tie between the Daytons and the Sacketts is supported by the fact that they both came from Panton County, Vermont.  It seems the Bristols also came from there.  West families are in New Haven, right next door.  But I can't find th
2 CONC e Daytons in the census for Panton.  Maybe they're in New Haven.

2 CONT Robinson and Rachael Lowery's deaths are recorded in the Coffee Creek Baptist Church Records. No tombstone inscriptions are recorded for them in the Coffee Creek Baptist Church Cemetery Records but I believe they are buried here because they wer
2 CONC e still members of the church at the time of their deaths. I searched for their markers on two occasions but found none and have come to the conclusion that there may have never been any tombstones or the gravestones were gone before the cemeter
2 CONC y records were recorded.

2 CONT It's All About Me
2 CONT 
2 CONT knight In the back pages of many books there is usually found a one-page section titled "About the Author" that presents some biographical information on the book's author. I thought it best that I provide these details up front because in one s
2 CONC ense this is "all about me". Along with my two brothers, one sister, and our descendents no one else can claim a complete affinity with all of the family branches presented here. Also I think that it would be a disservice to the reader for me no
2 CONC t the reveal who I am and what my connection is to the material presented here.
2 CONT 
2 CONT My name is David Michael DeBacker and I am, by profession, a software engineer, and with that, I spend my days writing computer programs or trying to figure out how to use programs written by others. By night and on the weekends, when my schedul
2 CONC e and other parts of my life allow, I can usually be found either researching my family's history, studying history in general, or writing about what I have read or discovered. As the reader will probably soon learn, I have no formal training a
2 CONC s a historian, a genealogist, or as a writer. For the most part, genealogy is a hobby, history is a passion, and writing is a form of therapy for me. Having said that, I do not want it to be inferred that I am making excuses for any mistakes, om
2 CONC issions, errors in spelling or grammar that are bound to pervade this book. In fact, I expect that this book may go through a number of revisions before it and I are finally laid to rest.
2 CONT 
2 CONT I was born in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C in 1955. My father, David DeBacker, was attending Georgetown University when he met my mother, Dorothy Patricia Dobbs, a crypto-clerk for the U.S. State Department. They met in the fal
2 CONC l of 1953, were married in June of 1954, and I was born in July of 1955. After my father graduated from the university, we moved to St Louis, Missouri sometime before the end of 1955 where my father completed a six-month Masters Degree program i
2 CONC n hospital administration. By late 1956, we were living in Fort Worth, Texas where my father began his career as a hospital administrator and my brother, Patrick, was born. In 1960, my father took a job at a hospital in Wharton, Texas and it wa
2 CONC s here that my sister Amy and my brother Gregory were born. By 1963, we were living in Houston, Texas and we remained in this city until a few years after I graduated from high school. In late 1976, we moved to south Florida and it was here tha
2 CONC t I joined the army.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Both of my parents had grown up during the Great Depression and World War II, but they did come from different backgrounds. My father grew up in Nebraska, leading the life of Andy Hardy as the son of a small town doctor. My mother grew up in Lou
2 CONC isville, Kentucky, went to high school in Nashville, Tennessee, and spent her childhood summers with relatives in Tampa, Florida. Both of their families were politically Democratic and religiously Roman Catholic.
2 CONT 
2 CONT My paternal grandfather (father's father) was of Belgian and French descent. My father's mother was as Irish as O'Hanlon's breech - to steal an Irish expression. While the family of my maternal grandmother hailed from Ulster (Northern Ireland) o
2 CONC n one side and from southern Germany on the other. My maternal grandfather's ancestors on one side were of British stock - predominately Welsh and Scotch/Irish - and were early (colonial) settlers in America. His mother's ancestors were of east-
2 CONC central German (Saxon) descent.

2 CONC .  Catherine died 28 Dec 1907 (1908?) and Henry's actual death was "20 years earlier" or about 1887 which coincides with the suicide attempt.  This Dayton could be related since a lot of Daytons were left behind when our Henry moved to Iowa.

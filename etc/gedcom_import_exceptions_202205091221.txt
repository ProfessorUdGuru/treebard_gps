EXCEPTIONS

The GEDCOM `FAM` tag is used during import to Treebard only to determine
relationships of persons within the family. If you had linked a source only
to a family, you should link it in Treebard to those family members elucidated
by the source. If you didn't link the source to a family unit, then your
software must have decided to add a link to a family unit that was created by
the software itself to match GEDCOM's structure. If you know you hadn't linked
sources to family units in the original, then ignore these links, since
Treebard doesn't create redundant family IDs on top of the individual and
relationship data which already exist in the database.
